## The Engine Programming Server's List of Game-Playing Engines
### Chess Engines

"*" ratings indicate a missing rating from the rating lists.

"~" prefix indicates that a rating is merely approximate.

"↓" prefix indicates that the rating was obtained with an older release of the engine.

All ratings are from single-CPU lists.

# Contributing
* Engines are sorted in descending order of their CCRL 40/15 rating.
* If you are:
    * Updating the version-number of an existing engine, but you lack a rating for it, prefix the earlier rating with an "↓".
    * Updating/adding an engine and the error margins of a rating is >30, prefix the rating with an "~".
