# Contributing
* Engines are sorted in descending order of their CCRL 40/15 rating, or their CCRL 40/2 FRC rating for Chess960.
* If you are:
    * Updating the version-number of an existing engine, but you lack a rating for it, prefix the earlier rating with an "↓".
    * Updating/adding an engine and the error margins of a rating is >30, prefix the rating with an "~".
